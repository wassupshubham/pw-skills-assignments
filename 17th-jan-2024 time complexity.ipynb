    "###Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - The function creates three lists: `left`, `middle`, and `right`.\n",
    "   - Each list is constructed using a list comprehension that iterates over the entire array `arr`. Thus, each list comprehension takes O(n) time, where `n` is the length of `arr`.\n",
    "   - This results in O(n) time to create the `left`, `middle`, and `right` lists combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Calls**:\n",
    "   - The function makes two recursive calls: `quicksort(left)` and `quicksort(right)`.\n",
    "   - If the pivot splits the array into `left` and `right` partitions, the size of `left` and `right` is roughly proportional to the size of the array excluding `middle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recurrence Relation**:\n",
    "   - For each recursive call, the array is divided into two smaller arrays, and the work done at each level is proportional to the size of the array.\n",
    "   - The recurrence relation for this algorithm is:\n",
    "\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     T(n) = T(\\text{size of left}) + T(\\text{size of right}) + O(n)\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In the average case, if the pivot is well-chosen and divides the array into roughly equal halves, the recurrence relation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     T(n) = 2T\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) + O(n)\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Solving this recurrence relation using the Master Theorem gives us O(n log n) time complexity for the average case.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Worst Case**:\n",
    "   - In the worst case, if the pivot always results in highly unbalanced partitions (e.g., smallest or largest element), the partitions will be of size `n-1` and 1, resulting in:\n",
    "\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This recurrence relation solves to O(n^2) time complexity, as the recursion tree has a depth of O(n) and each level requires O(n) time for partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**:\n",
    "  - The function creates new lists `left`, `middle`, and `right`, each of which can have up to O(n) space.\n",
    "  - Additionally, there is space used by the recursion stack. In the average case, the recursion depth is O(log n), but in the worst case, it is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "  Thus, the overall space complexity is:\n",
    "  - **Average Case**: O(n) (due to the space needed for lists and recursion stack)\n",
    "  - **Worst Case**: O(n) (due to the space needed for lists and recursion stack)\n",
